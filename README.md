 - Year-long "Scientific Initiation" project on stochastic processes, titled "Introdução às Cadeias Estocásticas com Memória de Alcance Variável" (Introduction to Variable Length Markov Chains).
   A study on VLMCs and later the development of an algorithm to extract the "skeleton" of a stochastic chain, as well as a proof of convergence and efficiency calculations.
   Submitted to and presented at the XXXIII Scientific Initiation Congress of UNICAMP, also published in the annals of the XXXVII Scientific Initiation Congress of UNESP (https://eventos.reitoria.unesp.br/anais/xxxviicicunesp/1406334-introducao-as-cadeias-estocasticas-com-memoria-de-alcance-variavel).
   An article is in development and will be published with direct influence of this work.

 - Implementation of an algorithm for weighted network clustering: Done over the course of a week for a machine learning class, I have not found an existing R package with an algorithm for weighted network clustering, and believe this showcases innovation, problem solving, and programming skills.
   "ME921_atividade_3.pdf" is the original file submitted for the class (in portuguese), and "WSBM_in_ASOIAF.pdf" is the english translation. An R package is in development to generalise this implementation.
